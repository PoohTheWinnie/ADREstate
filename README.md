# Hack-Brown21
Our Hack@Brown 2021 Submission title ADREstate.  Currently, black americans are being discriminated against during home appraisals.  Their appraisals may be tens of thousands of dollars lower than their fair, justified value.  This project aims to provide economic and social equality in real estate via a double blinded approach between the home owners and appraisers.
